# CommunicateRobot
A fun silly project to Communicate with Robots Through Remotes

Overall Goal:
  Get an LCD Display to respond appropriately to an IR remote (More detail added later)

## PHASE 1
Goal: 
  Figure out the LCD Display
Method: 
  1. Use the preset code for the LiquidCrystal Blink (this is not mine)
  2. set up the circuit accordingly
     -First in TinkerCAD to make sure the circuit does not burn out any of the components or any other similar mishaps
     -Then set up the circuit in real life to see it work
Results:
  Success. The LCD Display responded accordingly
## PHASE 2
Goal:
  Figure out the IR sensor and Remote Control
Method:
  1. Use code I found online (will link later)
  2. set up circuit accordingly

Results:
  We'll see
